Collaboration Notes

During Day 2, I initially faced difficulties.
Understanding the scope of tasks, particularly in structuring the system architecture overview and determining the level of detail required for APIs. 
To overcome this, I reviewed all the provided topics and reached out to my peers for guidance.
They shared examples and insights on structuring the system overview and clarifying API requirements.
This collaborative effort helped me align my approach with best practices and complete the task effectively. 
Their feedback was invaluable in ensuring my submission met the expected standards.
